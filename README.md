Cairn is a **universal, content-addressed build cache**. It hashes the inputs
to a build step, files the outputs in a deduplicated object store keyed by
content, and — when the same inputs come around again — hands the outputs back
instead of re-running the work. It does not care what language your build is
written in; it cares only about *bytes in* and *bytes out*.

The system is quarried from two tools that agree, seam for seam, on one format:

| Tool         | Language | Role in the section                                          |
| ------------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `cairn`      | Rust     | The engine — hashes, stores, restores, and *verifies* rock.  |
| `cairn-run`  | Go       | The surveyor — wraps any command; on a hit restores, not run.|

Both are built on standard libraries only — no third-party crates, no Go
modules beyond the toolchain. The content address is a **deterministic,
non-cryptographic FNV-1a** digest; that caveat is not a footnote — it is
load-bearing, and it is stated plainly throughout.
