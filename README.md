Cairn is a **universal, content-addressed build cache**. It hashes the inputs
to a build step, files the outputs in a deduplicated object store keyed by
content, and — when the same inputs come around again — hands the outputs back
instead of re-running the work. It does not care what language your build is
written in; it cares only about *bytes in* and *bytes out*.

The system is quarried from two tools that agree, seam for seam, on one format:

| Tool         | Language | Role in the section                                          |
| ------------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `cairn`      | Rust     | The engine — hashes, stores, restores, and *verifies* rock.  |
| `cairn-run`  | Go       | The surveyor — wraps any command; on a hit restores, not run.|

Both are built on standard libraries only — no third-party crates, no Go
modules beyond the toolchain. The content address is a **deterministic,
non-cryptographic FNV-1a** digest; that caveat is not a footnote — it is
load-bearing, and it is stated plainly throughout.

## Surface reading — the problem

Every build system re-does work it has already done: change one comment and the
toolchain recompiles a hundred files that did not move. Language-native caches
exist, but they are islands — Cargo does not know what `make` did, `go build`
does not know what your bundler did, and none share a cache with the shell
script gluing the pipeline together.

Cairn takes the opposite position. It treats a build step as an opaque
function — *declared inputs, a command, declared outputs* — and memoizes it by
content. If the inputs and the command hash to a key seen before, the recorded
outputs are laid back down verbatim and the command never runs. Because the key
is derived purely from bytes, a step cached by the Go wrapper is a legitimate
hit for the Rust engine, and the reverse — the common ground a polyglot pipeline
never otherwise had. It is deliberately a *small* idea executed carefully: Cairn
does not schedule, resolve dependency graphs, or discover inputs. You declare
them; it remembers them.

## Why two languages share one seam

A cache is only worth trusting if every tool that touches it computes the same
key and reads the same bytes. The two-language design exists to *prove* that
rather than assert it: the Go surveyor writes a manifest, the Rust engine
restores and verifies it, their keys match byte-for-byte, and the test suites
carry cross-language reference vectors so any drift fails CI immediately. The
contract that binds them is [`docs/FORMAT.md`](docs/FORMAT.md) — the normative
specification. This README is the field guide *to* that contract.

## Field kit — install &amp; build

You need a Rust toolchain (1.70+) and Go (1.21+; the module targets 1.24).

```bash
make build     # -> rust/target/release/cairn  and  bin/cairn-run
make test      # cargo test + go test ./...
make demo      # build everything, then run examples/demo.sh
make clean     # cargo clean + rm -rf bin .cairn-cache
```

To build each tool by hand: `cd rust && cargo build --release`, and
`cd go && go build -o ../bin/cairn-run ./cmd/cairn-run`.

## First descent — quickstart transcripts

Hash a file to see a content address (16 lowercase hex characters — a
zero-padded 64-bit FNV-1a digest), then wrap a real command. The first run is a
**cache MISS** (the command runs, its output is captured); the second is a
**cache HIT** (nothing executes, the output is laid back down):

```console
$ printf 'greetings from cairn' > input.txt
$ cairn hash input.txt
2e94eeb351265c82          20  input.txt

$ cairn-run --verbose --input input.txt --output output.txt -- \
      sh -c 'tr a-z A-Z < input.txt > output.txt'
cairn-run: cache MISS 8c165ae10d5fa0a2
cairn-run: stored manifest 8c165ae10d5fa0a2 (1 output(s))

$ rm output.txt   # then re-run the identical command
$ cairn-run --verbose --input input.txt --output output.txt -- \
      sh -c 'tr a-z A-Z < input.txt > output.txt'
cairn-run: cache HIT 8c165ae10d5fa0a2 (restored 1 output(s))
$ cat output.txt
GREETINGS FROM CAIRN
```

The output round-trips exactly; nothing recompiled. The [interop
section](#rust--go-interop) shows the engine reading and verifying this same
manifest.

## The three strata: MISS → STORE → HIT

Every wrapped command travels the same three-layer section:
