# Cairn Cache Format (v1)

This document is the normative specification of the Cairn on-disk format and
hashing scheme. Both the Rust engine (`cairn`) and the Go wrapper (`cairn-run`)
implement it exactly, so a cache produced by one tool is fully usable by the
other.

## 1. Content hashing

Cairn addresses content with the **64-bit FNV-1a** hash.

```
state = 0xcbf29ce484222325            (offset basis)
for each byte b in input:
    state = state XOR b
    state = (state * 0x00000100000001b3) mod 2^64   (wrapping multiply)
```

The **canonical digest** is the final `state` rendered as a zero-padded,
lowercase, 16-character hexadecimal string (`%016x`).

### Reference vectors

| Input      | Canonical digest     |
| ---------- | -------------------- |
| `""`       | `cbf29ce484222325`   |
| `"a"`      | `af63dc4c8601ec8c`   |
| `"foobar"` | `85944171f73967e8`   |

Both implementations assert these vectors in their unit tests.

### ⚠️ Non-cryptographic

FNV-1a is **not** a cryptographic hash. It has no collision resistance or
pre-image resistance against a deliberate attacker. Cairn is a build cache, not
a security boundary. FNV-1a was chosen because it is:

- **Deterministic** across platforms, architectures, and languages.
- **Dependency-free** — expressible in a few lines in any language.
- **Fast** and adequate for detecting *accidental* change (the actual job of a
  build cache).

Do not use Cairn digests to defend against malicious tampering. If you need
that, layer a signed manifest or a cryptographic digest on top.

## 2. Cache key

A cache key identifies a logical build step. It is the FNV-1a canonical digest
of the following byte stream, where `\x00` is a single NUL byte:

```
"cairn-key\x00"
<format-version-decimal> "\x00"
for each input entry, sorted ascending by path:
    <path>   "\x00"
    <digest> "\x00"
    <size-decimal> "\x00"
"cmd\x00"
for each command argument, in order:
    <arg> "\x00"
```

- `format-version-decimal` is the decimal ASCII of the format version (`1`).
- Inputs **must** be sorted by `path` (byte-wise ascending) before hashing.
- `path` uses forward slashes on all platforms.
- `size-decimal` is the decimal ASCII of the byte length.

Because the command participates in the key, changing the command (or any
argument) yields a different key, so unrelated steps never collide.

## 3. Manifest JSON

A manifest is a single JSON object serialized **canonically**: compact (no
insignificant whitespace) with keys in the fixed order below.

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "producer": "cairn-go",
  "key": "6021f3a455f5af1f",
  "command": ["cc", "-c", "main.c", "-o", "main.o"],
  "inputs": [
    {"path": "main.c", "digest": "af63dc4c8601ec8c", "size": 123}
  ],
  "outputs": [
    {"path": "main.o", "digest": "85944171f73967e8", "size": 456}
  ]
}
```

Field semantics:

| Field      | Type              | Meaning                                              |
| ---------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `version`  | unsigned integer  | Format version; currently `1`.                       |
| `producer` | string            | Tool that wrote it: `cairn-rust` or `cairn-go`.      |
| `key`      | string            | The cache key (§2).                                  |
| `command`  | array of strings  | The command line (may be empty for pure hashing).    |
| `inputs`   | array of entries  | Hashed inputs, sorted by `path`.                     |
| `outputs`  | array of entries  | Captured outputs, sorted by `path`.                  |

An **entry** is an object with keys `path` (string), `digest` (string), and
`size` (unsigned integer), in that order.

String escaping follows RFC 8259: `"`, `\`, `\n`, `\r`, `\t` use short escapes;
other control characters (`< 0x20`) use lowercase `\uXXXX`.

## 4. On-disk layout

Relative to the cache root (default `.cairn-cache`):

```
<root>/
  objects/<aa>/<digest>       content blob; <aa> = first two hex chars of digest
  manifests/<key>.json        canonical manifest, one file per key
```

- Blobs are content-addressed and therefore automatically deduplicated: two
  outputs with identical bytes share one blob.
- Writes are atomic: content is written to a `.tmp` sibling and renamed into
  place.

## 5. Verification

Verifying a key means:

1. Every output blob referenced by the manifest exists.
2. Each blob re-hashes to its recorded digest (detects accidental corruption).
3. Recomputing the key (§2) from the manifest's inputs and command equals the
   stored `key` (detects manifest tampering with the index).

A cache is *healthy* for a key when all three hold.

## 6. Compatibility guarantees

- The two implementations produce **byte-identical** manifests for the same
  logical entry.
- Either tool can restore and verify a manifest written by the other.
- New format versions bump `version`; readers should reject versions they do
  not understand.
