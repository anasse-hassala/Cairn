//! The Cairn manifest: the canonical, cross-language description of a cache
//! entry.
//!
//! A manifest records the inputs that were hashed to produce a cache key, the
//! outputs that were captured, and provenance metadata. Both the Rust engine
//! and the Go wrapper serialize manifests with identical field names and an
//! identical canonicalization scheme so the two tools are fully
//! interoperable. The wire format is documented in `docs/FORMAT.md`.
